# STUDENT-TRANSPORTATION-NOTIFICATION-SYSTEM
Internet of Things and Web Application

## Description
The Internet of Things (IoT) has undeniably transformed the way we interact with the world around us. School is the second-best place for kids to inculcate education and ethical values, next to home. Providing safety for the students throughout transportation to and from the school plays a vital role. This project helps parents monitor the position of the school bus, including pickup and drop timings of the student, through an application. In this system, we make use of RFID and GPS technologies and connect them to a remote server over WIFI using a microcontroller. A GPS module is used to determine the current geographic coordinates of the vehicle's location. An RFID reader identifies each student as they board or alight from the vehicle by reading the ID from their RFID tags. The information can be accessed by parents through an application, helping them track their wards effectively. The bus driver can use one switch to notify parents that the bus has started and another switch to report any damages to the administration. The school administration can also access the application to ensure student.
